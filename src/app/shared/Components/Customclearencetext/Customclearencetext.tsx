          In the global marketplace, rapidly changing production and delivery
          schedule requirements have increased the liability of customs brokers
          to provide expert clearance services. Rolling Cargo Ltd is widely
          recognized as one of Kenyaâ€™s premier customs brokers. Rolling Cargo
          has a longstanding professional relationship with government agencies
          and this hard-earned and privileged status offers a distinctive
          advantage when it comes to difficult negotiations of shipments and
          challenges posed by bureaucratic processes in Kenya. <br /> <br /> Regardless of how
          quickly a shipment arrives in Kenya, the complexity of customs
          procedures and documentation requirements can result in undefined
          delays that are costly to recipients. Rolling Cargo Customs Brokers
          are perfectly trained to understand the complex customs procedures of
          each line of business. <br /> <br />Our customs brokerage team will be fully
          responsible for ensuring that the appropriate documentation is
          prepared well before all import and export deadlines so that costly
          and time-consuming delays are avoided. To further enhance this aspect
          of our business, Rolling Cargo Ltd maintains a bonded warehouse
          network across Kenya. These facilities, suitable for any type of
          cargo, can be reached by road, rail or air and ensure that shipments
          are cleared quickly upon arrival. <br /> <br /> Our Customs Services include: Import
          / Export Customs Clearance Service Customs Evaluation of merchandise
